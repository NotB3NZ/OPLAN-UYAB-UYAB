                    <p>My Dearest Kristina,</p>
                    <p>[LONG MESSAGE AHEAD]</p>
                    <p>To kick it off, I want to say sorry cos sige kog learn ug programming the past week. The reason was that I wanted to learn how to do it pero in actuality, I wanted to make you one of these. FIRST TIME NI NAKO SO BAWAL BASHER!!! Pero honestly think I did well mwehehehe😎😎</p>
                    <p> <big>AAANNYYYWAYSSSS</big> </p>
                    <p>I remember pa bibi noh dire na pic jud nag sugod ang tanan. IS WHAT I WOULD SAY IF WALA TAKA GI SUNDO SA AIRPORT AS YOU "BOYGUARD" PERO WALA MAN TAY PIC ATO TOGETHER SO KINI NALANG HASDHAHDSHAD. </p>
                    <p>This past year bibi, I keep telling you and I will keep on telling you na I am forever grateful to ever be with a girl with soul as beautiful as yours. No ifs no buts. Even before we were official I always knew jud na you're the girl for me and it was of my best interest to really secure my spot as your man.
                        The same way everything I say about you comes true, the same is true with my words. First was I promised you na I'd make sure na we are able to make the most of your last three months before going on to study at DLSU. Second, I promised you na I'd make you my girlfriend. Third, I told you na ipa anniversary taka and guess what? Here we are.
                        Ang wala ra jud natuman kay tung everyday mu budots pero thats besides the point MWEHEHEHHEEE
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While writing this Im trying to keep track of the website ba and I noticed na tungod kay portrait ang kaning frame, tas medyo narrow ang text box. it looks <i>hasol</i> to read. I AGREE PERO BAWAL TAPOLON UG BASAAAAA!!!!😤😤😤</p>
                    <p>I remember pa ba na I told your friends na di ko 'date to marry' rather I am a 'date until time allows us'-- doing shit to make things happen, but never force it. Wherein instead of a very future oriented approach, as dating to marry can sometimes become 'performative' cause makita nako akong friends na DTM just settling in a relationship always trying to 'fix the boat' kay theyre terrified of never reaching the altar,
                        we are instead a couple who feels free to show our true selves without the pressure of always keeping checkboxes of a 'bride/groom-to-be'. A relationship where we stay together because we want to be here TODAY, not because we <i>promised</i> to be there in ten years.
                        What I really love about our relationship is that though gusto nato na kita jud in the end (in which we probably will mwehhehee), we do whatever feels natural and not force anything unnatural. Bisang data science ko and my job is literally predicting the future with math, statistics, and programming, we cannot really <i>predict</i> the future.
                    <p>
                    <p> And I really believe that the best way to forever is to have a series of really healthy "todays" :></p>
                    <p>And bisang ldr ta, busy ta (yesyes IK na very busy sad ko and I get easily distracted), my todays are forever bright and much fun-er to get through cause I have you. Na bisang nagkanda leche-leche na akong kinabuhi I have a girlfriend I can always rely on. Lately grabe among family stuff and I cannot really tell you the details, my mood is always softened kay I know I have a loving girlfriend.
                        And I just want you to know bibi na Im super happy to be spending my todays with you💕
                    </p> 
                    <p>Thank you so much bibi for always being there. Thank you for always being understanding, for always loving me and loving me how I wish to be loved and more. Yk bibi I really love jud how sweet you are. SUPER SUPER PRECIOUS!!! Im Golumn and youre the ring kase youre my precious. Its so backwards na LDR ta, very quality time people ta, and yet we barely have any. Tas when we do, dali ra ko ma distract cause I have a lot of things na I want to do rin.
                        Honestly bibi ma guilty gud ko ana cause I really dont know how to properly control kanang mga digital conversations my hands always reach for something-- even my feet (coding with a basketball as my footstool). Though, I believe na Im a very effective <i>in-person conversationist</i> (idk if that a word). I love it gani when were together kay mu baba ang akong screentime. Only ever opening my phone to take photos or check notifs. Pero yeah I am sorry bibi sa akong pagkukulang cause yk, I always feel so blessed
                        na I have a girlfriend na always ga yearn and crave sa akong attention and I always feel loved and secure tapos sometimes di nako ma reciprocate fully :CC 
                    </p>
                    <p>Pero I'm really thankful jud for you bibi. You're someone I never get ashamed to flaunt to anybody. When people come up to tell me how they love seeing us together, I really understand them. Mas na fully realize jud nako siya bibi na whenever mag tapok2 mi or someone reaches out to me for advice, I can refer to our relationship and how we deal with things and how our love prevails. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Thank you so much bibi for letting me in your family. Sauna I remember I spoke about it with Mabe how much family is important in dating. Tas what she said was really eye opening. Ana siya an she was the same way pero now, having went through what she went through, lisod na jud daw mag legal ug balik. "Its scary cause for all you know you're introducing a potential heartbreak right in your living room" ana siya. I just want to reassure you bibi na
                        I am very honored to be this close with your family bisang di pa jud welcomed as in welcomed-welcomed, I will assure you na it you never regret the decision na gi legal ko nimo. I think you have a lovely family and I even idolize your dad big time. I will be careful with their heart as I am with yours. 
                    </p>
                    <p>We've been through so much and there will so much more in store for our love. There will be doors, trap doors, and fences. There will be short days, there will be long days. There will be days where youre atlas, another day you're Zephyrus. To be spending those days with you, I could not be any more excited.</p>
                    <p>Its still crazy to me na we're two very different people and yet we complement each other so well. Sa uban couples, dali ra kaayo sila maka think unsa ilahang similarities may it be hobbies, movies, degrees, pero kita lahi jud. So akong duty kay hinay hinayan takag ipa like ang akong world tas ako sad I will try kung unsa ba na imong fandoms HASDHSAHDHASD.</p>
                    <p>Pero what I'm trying to say is though we are very different, we never realized na nag one month na ta, tapos second, tapos sixth, tapos ninth, tapos now, a full anniversary. As much I wish to be there as I was last year, di jud siya possible this year bibiii :C We've talked through it na pero I reallly still get sad cause I really tried pero wa jud nakaya. It wasn't realistic jud with my current situation pero I really tried :CC</p>
                    <p>PERO THATS DIFFERENT NAAAA WHAT MATTERS IS TODAY!!!</p>
                    <p>Im so excited to share this day with you bibiiii may this be our first of many and many more!!! Lets continue to build our world by building a world together in stardew valley HASDHSAHDAHDA I hope ma appreciate ni nimo akong mini project bibi HSADHAHDA nag enjoy jud kog learn and buhat ani. Tas fulfilling jud to be making this to make you smile.</p>
                    <p>I hope you enjoy my gifttttt I've always wanted to get you one so voilaaaaa also bibi yk I'm a little sad rn (Me inserting this bit 1/12/25 1:37) cause di ko sure if I can get you flowers :C way tarong akong ka storyaa. BUT BUT BUT may this day be filled with loveeeee</p>
                    <p>No lies are told when I say na never jud ko nag regret sa akong decisions with dating you. My TAE is well spent. Kay I spent it on you.</p>
                    <p>You've had a very significant impact sa akong world bibi. I honestly believe na I get to have a shot at oppportunities because I'm with you and you always cause you good luck. My biggest driving force baya bibi is someday finally being able to reach the bar your family set. I will not subject you to anything less. I will make your parents proud bibi I want to show them na they entrusted their daughter to the right man.</p>
                    <p>I cant wait to spend my future with you bibiii so let's build out our todays :> </p>

                    <p>HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!!!</p>
                    <p>I love you so much! 😚</p>
